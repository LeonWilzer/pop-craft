# Signature

A very simple Fabric mod, which allows you to sign items with an optional description.

## Usage
Hold the item stack you want to sign in your main (right) hand and execute the following command:
`/signstack <description>`

If <description> is the description you want the item to have. If left empty, the description will be left out.
Items can be signed arbitrarily often.
